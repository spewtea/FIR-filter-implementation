## Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter implementation
  ### This project demonstrates how noisy signals can be filtered using an FIR and IIR filters
  ### This project was done as a part of the course Digital Signal Processing
  ### First a signal is generated. Then there as an addition of noise - Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
  ### This noisy signal is passed through FIR and IIR filters to obtain a more dominant signal that is free from noise
