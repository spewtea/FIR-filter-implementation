## Filtering of noisy signals using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters
### This project demonstrates how noisy signals can be filtered using FIR and IIR filters
This project was done as a part of the course Digital Signal Processing
First, a signal is generated. Then there is an addition of noise - Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
This noisy signal is passed through FIR and IIR filters to obtain a more dominant signal that is free from noise
