## Filtering of noisy signals using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters
### This project demonstrates how noisy signals can be filtered using FIR and IIR filters
This project was done as a part of the course Digital Signal Processing.
The added noise type is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
This noisy signal is passed through FIR and IIR filters to obtain a more dominant signal free from noise.
